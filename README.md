# Visualizing American excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic by race and ethnicity
#### Reese Richardson, 21/03/29

American communities of color have shouldered a disproportionate share of the COVID-19 pandemic’s burden. For instance, at peak, Hispanic/Latino Americans experienced a weekly all-cause death burden 130.9% in excess of previous years. Not all excess deaths are directly attributable to COVID-19—there is emerging evidence that delays in care associated with pandemic-related closures and shortages also contributed to increased mortality among all demographics<sup>[1](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6936a4.htm)</sup>. The phenomenon of increased death burden among American minority groups reflects a higher COVID-19 disease burden, poorer access to quality health care services, and increased prevalence of comorbid conditions for COVID-19 relative to White Americans.

### The following visualizations show weekly all-cause deaths by race and ethnicity over time, from 2014 to early 2021.

Data is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Health Statistics (CDC-NCHS). Find the raw data [here](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Weekly-counts-of-deaths-by-jurisdiction-and-race-a/qfhf-uhaa) or in the [directory 'data'](https://github.com/reeserich/visualize_excess_deaths/tree/main/data). Names of racial and ethnic groups presented reflect those used by the CDC-NCHS. Data in recent weeks are incomplete--only 60% of death records are submitted to CDC-NCHS within 10 days of the date of death, and completeness varies by jurisdiction. Video files of each image can be found in the [directory 'mp4'](https://github.com/reeserich/visualize_excess_deaths/tree/main/mp4).
